# TODO: Back sprites for LGPE are showing in excel checklist because game isn't in filename for back sprites
    # Since filename only contains Gen7, the SM-USUM photos trigger the "x" in the LGPE column
        # They ARE different because SMUSUM was on the 3ds, LGPE is on the Switch

# TODO: This script will take all back sprites of each game in a generation up to gen 4 to compare them and see if they're different
    # If they are different between games in a gen, add game to the filename
    # Otherwise, just gen is fine
